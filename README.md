⚠️ **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen operates by generating a vast number of potential wallet addresses, using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, and [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-based chains like Ethereum.

This process then involves checking the generated addresses against existing databases or performing real-time balance checks using public blockchain explorers.  This systematic approach enables the tool to pinpoint wallets that may contain your missing funds.

Built in C++, and open-source, WalletGen provides transparency and allows customization. When compared to alternatives, Wallet Gen provides significantly higher wallet generation speeds, thanks to its utilization of your CPU & GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** allows you to search for crypto wallets that contain a balance using a brute-force method.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Choose option 3 in the menu or execute start_search_btc.bat to search for Bitcoin wallets via the internet. Note that this method may be slower, because it relies on real-time checks through blockchain explorers.
*   Select option 6 to search for Bitcoin wallets using the database. This method provides faster search results by comparing generated wallets with a pre-built database of known addresses that have balances.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Select option 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets using the internet. This method checks for wallets that have balances in real-time via blockchain explorers.
*   Choose option 6 to search EVM wallets utilizing the database. This is more efficient, since it compares generated wallets against a database of addresses that are known to contain balances.

### Speed Considerations:

*   The speed of the search is heavily reliant on your hardware, especially the graphics card (GPU). To speed up the process and increase the likelihood of discovering a wallet with a balance, consider running multiple program instances (1 to 4), based on your system's performance capabilities.

Utilizing the database significantly boosts search efficiency, reducing the requirement for querying the blockchain for every generated wallet.

## The Program Found a Wallet — What’s Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance, it will:
*   **Immediately halt** the search.
*   **Display** the wallet details in the console.
*   **Save** this data in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### How to Access the Funds:
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the recovered wallet into a compatible crypto wallet application (such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  Once restored, you can transfer the funds to your own secure wallet.

> If you successfully locate a wallet with funds, please consider donating a small portion of the recovered balance as a token of appreciation.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen offers functionalities that enable you to recover your Bitcoin wallet by seed phrase (mnemonic phrase). The program offers the ability to input a complete seed phrase, as well as searching for missing words utilizing special characters.

### Process Explanation

#### Searching for Missing Words:

If some words in your seed phrase are missing, or if you are uncertain of them, use an *. WalletGen will then search through all possible word combinations in place of * to identify the correct seed phrase and restore the corresponding wallet balance.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

If you have the full 12-word seed phrase, you can simply enter it into the program. WalletGen will generate different address types (Legacy, SegWit, P2SH) and verify their balances.

### Important Recommendations

*   The seed phrase must be exactly 12 words.
*   Utilize only the * symbol to represent any missing words.
*   Searching for missing words can be time-consuming, especially if several words are unknown.
*   If wallet recovery, where a balance is present, is successful, the program will automatically halt and save all findings.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/assets/panel.webp)

I’ve personally recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first contained 0.000032 BTC, and the second had 0.0528 BTC (worth approximately $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here’s the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
